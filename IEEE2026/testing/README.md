# Testing and Simulation

This area holds tools, datasets, and notes for validating the robot in simulation and on hardware benches.

## What Belongs Here
- Simulation environments and configuration files (e.g., Gazebo, Webots, custom Python scripts).
- Bench test harnesses for subsystems such as drive motors, manipulators, or sensors.
- Recorded telemetry, log files, and analysis notebooks.

## Usage Guidelines
1. Organize new tooling into descriptive subdirectories (e.g., `simulation/`, `hardware/`, `data/`).
2. Provide setup instructions, dependencies, and run commands for each test harness.
3. Include expected results or acceptance criteria to help other members reproduce your findings.

## Reporting Results
- Summarize key findings in markdown files or link to documentation in `../docs`.
- Note any hardware-specific requirements (power supplies, fixtures, safety considerations).
- Keep test assets synchronized with the movement and SEC codebases to catch regressions early.
