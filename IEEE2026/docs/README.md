# Documentation Hub

Use this folder to collect subsystem design notes, field diagrams, meeting minutes, and external references relevant to the 2026 build season.

## Suggested Structure
- `architecture/` – block diagrams, interface definitions, and system-level design documents.
- `hardware/` – wiring schematics, CAD exports, and vendor datasheets.
- `software/` – API references, flowcharts, and onboarding guides.
- `planning/` – sprint plans, retrospectives, and risk assessments.

Feel free to create additional folders as the season progresses, but keep the README up to date so newcomers can navigate easily.

## Best Practices
- Prefer editable source formats (e.g., draw.io, Markdown) and include export instructions when using proprietary tools.
- Link to large assets stored in shared drives rather than committing binaries that exceed repository limits.
- Reference related testing artifacts in `../testing` to keep documentation and validation connected.
